EC535 Final Project compilation

---------------------------------------------------------

/km/
Makefile - same as previous labs and should be compiled in the same way.

---------------------------------------------------------

/QT/
Makefile - followed the directions from lab 5 with the Makefile compiling 
in the same way. However the include and lib directory contain the libsndfile
cross compiled object file and header files. These are needed for QT to compile
successfully.
The files inside the lib directory should be transfered over to the gumstix 
board to /usr/lib/ prior to running the QT code.

---------------------------------------------------------

libsndfile
The sources can be found in the libsndfile-1.0.26.tar.gz and should be cross
compiled for the gumstix board. The source make files were created with the
automake and autoconf tools and thus cross compiling should be done with 
the following configuration.

./configure --prefix=./Arm --build=i386-linux --host=arm-linux

when this is successful should run:

make install

There will be errors with the test cases run after the make is performed,
these should be ignored because the library object files and header files
will be successfully created.
