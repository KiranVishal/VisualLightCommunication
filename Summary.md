Visual Light Communication

A Gui was displayed on an LCD screen, used to select the music file to be played. It also displayed addition information such
as time elapsed, track name and volume controls.

This information was given to a Gumstix Board (This hardware had to be used as per the course rules), the gumstix board had gpio
headers. The headers provided a PWM to the anolog circuit; this circuit had an led to produce the light fluctuations.

The other end of the communication had a photo diode to sense the change in light. This was used to drive a speaker which played
the music.
